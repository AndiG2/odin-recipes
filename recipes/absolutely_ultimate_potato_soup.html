        <p>Cook the celery, onion, and garlic in the remaining bacon grease. Add cubed potatoes and toss with veggies. Return the bacon to the pan and cover all the ingredients with chicken stock. Cover and simmer until the potatoes are tender.

            In a separate skillet, whisk butter into melted flour until slightly thickened. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the mixture to a boil and cook until thick and creamy.
